### Hi I'm Hassan ğŸ‘‹ğŸ’»

I'm a two time startup founder, software engineer consultant, and student majoring in Computer Engineering. I founded UltraShock Gaming, a game marketing startup with a community of half a million members on Steam, and co-founded Gaia Technologies, a drone AI startup that helps farmers identify early diseases in crops and optimize pesticide use. I'm very passionate about startups and solving problems using software!
