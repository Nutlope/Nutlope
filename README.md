### Hi I'm Hassan ðŸ‘‹ðŸ’»

> I'm a two time startup founder, software engineer, content creator, and final year student majoring in Computer Engineering. 

I founded [UltraShock Gaming](https://twitter.com/ushockgaming), a game marketing startup with a community of 500,000 members on Steam, and ran it for 5 years before [selling it](https://www.elmghari.com/startup-journey/). I'm  passionate about startups and solving problems using software.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently taking classes, working on an early stage startup idea and building a [covid tracker web app](https://uscovidtracker.org/) in my free time.
- ðŸŒ± Check out my [blog](https://elmghari.com) where I document my journey and learn in public.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to say hi on <a href="https://twitter.com/Nutlope">Twitter</a> or [Email](mailto:hassan@hey.com).
