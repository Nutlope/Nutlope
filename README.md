### Hi I'm Hassan 👋💻

> I'm a two time startup founder, consultant, and final year student majoring in Computer Engineering. 

I founded [UltraShock Gaming](https://twitter.com/ushockgaming), a game marketing startup with a community of 500,000 members on Steam, and ran it for 5 years before [selling it](https://www.elmghari.com/startup-journey/). I'm passionate about startups and solving problems using software.

- 👨‍💻 Exploring full-stack web development (React, Node, AWS) by building side projects
- ✍️  Documenting my journey and learning in public on my [blog](https://elmghari.com) and <a href="https://twitter.com/Nutlope">Twitter</a>
