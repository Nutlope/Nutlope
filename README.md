### Hi I'm Hassan ğŸ‘‹ğŸ’»

I'm a two time startup founder, software engineer, and student majoring in Computer Engineering. I founded UltraShock Gaming, a game marketing startup with a community of half a million members on Steam, and just sold it in September of 2020 to two gaming companies. I'm very passionate about startups and solving problems using software!
